### Needs bug fix for backend:
- i will be redoing the backend or at least updating the backend to make it ES6 syntax (import) instead of Common JS (require). i suspect that there something with how the backend was implemented that's making the deployment not working properly. currently unable to fetch with using the existing routes when deployed with Vercel
